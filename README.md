#Description:

The objective of this task is to develop a Recommendation System using Collaborative Filtering or Matrix Factorization techniques. Recommendation systems are widely used in e-commerce, streaming services, and content platforms to suggest items based on user preferences.
Steps Involved:
1. Load a dataset with user-item interactions (e.g., MovieLens dataset).
2. Preprocess the data and create a user-item matrix.
3. Implement Collaborative Filtering using techniques like Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) or K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
4. Evaluate the system using metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) and Precision@K.
5. Showcase recommendations for specific users.
